Assignment #1 System Evaluation</h1>
<h2>For this assignment, I am doing an evaluation of <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a> a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that provides access to downloadable ebooks for free.  </h2>

<p>Project Gutenberg was started in 1971 by Michael Hart.  Hart is credited as the inventor of the ebook and was given $100,000,000 worth of computer time in the Materials Research Lab at the University of Illinois.  This was done through a family connection.  Hart believed that once something had been uploaded to the internet, it could be replicated over and over again.  Henceforth, that information was available for generations to come.  The actual system feels very straightforward to use.  The download of an ebook was very quick and free of issues.  The actual text of the book, when downloaded, is straightforward as well.  There is a page on the site that describes every format in which ebooks can be downloaded along with what devices can accept those formats.  Along with specific information on how to download an ebook to an Amazon Kindle.</p>

The organization’s stated goal is to provide books to absolutely anyone.  Due to the ease of use of the system, it does accomplish that goal.  Anyone that has access to the internet can use Project Gutenberg effectively.  The content on the site is separated into categories that can be accessed at the top of the homepage.  Along with this, there are features that highlight the most frequently downloaded books and separate books into reading lists separated by keywords.  The books on the site are all in the public domain.  Every download page has an “About this ebook” section that describes the author’s name, the publishing date of the version on the website, etc.  There are also some elements of this section that were unexpected surprises such as: reading level, credits for those who edited or altered this version of the book, and copyright status.  The system boasts over 75,000 ebooks available for download.  With a steady stream of ebooks being added to the website daily.</p>

As stated earlier, the ability to download ebooks is an easy process.  There is an ability to download onto a phone or a tablet which is a nice addition.  A few things that maybe helpful towards promoting the website include <ul>
  <li>Promotion of the instructions for downloading books onto iphone or android devices.</li>
  <li>Promotion of specific books to draw attention to the site.</li>
  <li>An option for the user to build a list of books they would like to read at a later date.</li>
</ul>
